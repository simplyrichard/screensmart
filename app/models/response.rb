# A stateless response to a given set of questions.
# Initializing is done by setting answer_values as a hash, for example:
#   r = Response.new(answer_values: { 'EL02' => 1 })
#
# After this, all attributes can be read in an OOP way, for example:
#   r.questions # All questions, including the next (unanswered) one
#   # => [#<Question:0x007faadb3459a8 @id="EL02", @answer_value: 1>,
#         #<Question:0x007faadb2d49d8 @id="EL03">]
